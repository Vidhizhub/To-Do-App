# To-Do-App
# Features of the Project

1. Adding a Task
Users can input a task in a text field and click the add button to store it.
The task appears in the list with three action buttons: Complete, Alert, and Delete.

2. Marking a Task as Completed
Clicking the ✅ (check) button toggles the completed status of a task.
The completed tasks are visually distinguished.

3. Marking a Task as Urgent
Clicking the ⚠️ (alert) button toggles an "urgent" status.
Urgent tasks can be filtered separately.

4. Deleting a Task
Clicking the 🗑️ (trash) button removes the task from both the UI and local storage.

5. Filtering Tasks
Users can filter tasks based on their status:
All: Shows all tasks.
Completed: Shows only tasks marked as completed.
Incomplete: Shows tasks that are not marked as completed.
Urgent: Shows only urgent tasks.

6. Storing Tasks in Local Storage
Tasks are stored in localStorage, allowing users to keep their to-dos even after closing and reopening the browser.
